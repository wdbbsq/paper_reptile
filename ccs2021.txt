Analyzing structural properties of social networks, such as identifying their clusters or finding their central nodes, has many applications. However, these applications are not supported by federated social networks that allow users to store their social contacts locally on their end devices. In the federated regime, users want access to personalized services while also keeping their social contacts private. In this paper, we take a step towards enabling analytics on federated networks with differential privacy guarantees about protecting the user's social contacts. Specifically, we present the first work to compute hierarchical cluster trees using local differential privacy. Our algorithms for computing them are novel and come with theoretical bounds on the quality of the trees learned. Empirically, our differentially private algorithms learn trees that are of comparable quality (with at most about 10% utility loss) to the trees obtained from the non-private algorithms, while having reasonable privacy (0.5 łeq ε łeq 2). Private hierarchical cluster trees enable new application setups where a service provider can query the community structure around a target user without having their social contacts. We show the utility of such queries by redesigning two state-of-the-art social recommendation algorithms for the federated social network setup. Our recommendation algorithms significantly outperform the baselines that do not use social contacts.

分析社会网络的结构属性，如识别其集群或找到其中心节点，有许多应用。然而，联邦社交网络不支持这些应用程序，后者允许用户在终端设备本地存储社交联系人。在联邦机制中，用户希望访问个性化服务，同时也希望保持社交联系的私密性。在本文中，我们朝着在联邦网络上实现分析迈出了一步，在保护用户的社交联系方面，我们提供了不同的隐私保障。具体来说，我们提出了使用局部差异隐私来计算层次簇树的第一项工作。我们计算这些树的算法是新颖的，并且对学习到的树的质量有理论限制。根据经验，我们的差异化私有算法学习的树与非私有算法获得的树的质量相当(最多10%的效用损失)，同时有合理的隐私(0.5 łeq ε łeq 2)。私有的分层聚类树使新的应用程序设置，其中服务提供商可以查询目标用户的社区结构，而不需要他们的社交联系。我们通过重新设计两种最先进的社交网络推荐算法来展示这种查询的实用性。我们的推荐算法明显优于不使用社交联系的基线。
